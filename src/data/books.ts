    title: "Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus",
    author: "Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley",
    isbn: "9780718197032",
    publishedYear: 1818,
    genre: "Gothic fiction, Science fiction, Horror",
    description: "Frankenstein is a haunting exploration of ambition, creation, and the consequences of playing god. It tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who brings life to a creature made from corpses — only to be horrified by what he’s created. Beyond its gothic horror, the novel dives deep into loneliness, responsibility, and what it truly means to be human. Shelley’s writing feels both poetic and unsettling, reminding readers how thin the line can be between genius and madness, and between creation and destruction.",

    personalComments: "Reading Frankenstein was nothing like I expected. It’s not just about a monster — it’s about humanity itself. I was surprised by how much sympathy I felt for the creature; he starts as innocent as a child, only to be driven into darkness by rejection and cruelty. Shelley’s words made me think about how society shapes people — how easily kindness could have changed everything. The loneliness and guilt in the story hit hard, especially when Frankenstein realizes too late the cost of his obsession. It’s one of those books that lingers, not because of its horror, but because of its heartbreak.",

Through stories of history’s most captivating figures — from Cleopatra to Casanova — he breaks down the subtle power dynamics that shape human desire. The book is provocative and strategic, blending history, psychology, and manipulation into a fascinating study of how charm and emotional intelligence can be used to win over hearts and minds.",

Greene doesn’t just talk about romance — he reveals how seduction operates in business, politics, and everyday interactions. Some parts feel dark and even uncomfortable, but that’s what makes it so interesting; it forces you to face the hidden motives behind human behavior. I found myself reflecting on the difference between genuine connection and calculated influence. Even if you don’t agree with every tactic, it’s impossible to read this book without becoming more aware of how people — including yourself — try to attract, impress, or control others. It’s one of those rare books that’s both unsettling and empowering.",

    personalComments: "Reading The Shallows was a thought-provoking journey into how the internet is reshaping not just our habits, but the very structure of our brains. Carr’s writing made me reflect on my own distracted patterns and the way digital media chips away at my ability to focus deeply. I found myself questioning how often I skim instead of read, and how much of my memory and creativity I’ve outsourced to devices. The historical context Carr provides—tracing the evolution from print to digital—gave me a new appreciation for the silent, internal dialogue of deep reading. \n\nWhat really struck me was how relevant the book feels in our hyper-connected lives. Every day, I notice how easy it is to bounce from notification to notification, rarely giving anything my full attention. Carr doesn’t just sound the alarm for the sake of it; he invites the reader to pause and consider what’s at stake when we allow our minds to be shaped by the demands of the digital world. There’s a tension between the convenience and wonder of technology and the subtle erosion of our ability to think slowly, to let ideas simmer, to remember and synthesize rather than just consume. \n\nAfter finishing The Shallows, I started to reconsider my own reading habits. I realized how seldom I lose myself in a book for hours the way I did as a child, and how quickly I feel the urge to check my phone or open a new tab at the slightest hint of boredom. The book made me nostalgic for the immersive, almost meditative experience of deep reading, but it also left me feeling a sense of urgency to reclaim that space for myself. \n\nCarr’s arguments can feel a bit alarmist at times, but honestly, I think that’s part of the point—the changes are subtle but profound. The most valuable takeaway for me was the idea of being intentional about how I use technology. Since reading it, I’ve tried to set aside pockets of time for uninterrupted reading, to leave my phone in another room, and to notice when I’m slipping into shallow habits online. It’s not about rejecting the internet or digital tools, but about finding a sense of balance and protecting the parts of my mind that thrive on depth, reflection, and real engagement. I’m still figuring out what that looks like in practice, but The Shallows gave me both the motivation and the framework to start. If you ever feel like your attention is fraying or you miss the pleasure of getting lost in a book, this is a must-read. It’s a wake-up call, but also a hopeful reminder that we can still choose how we shape our minds in a noisy world.",

    personalComments: "Reading Tafsir Ibn Kathir is a humbling and transformative experience. It’s not just a scholarly text, but a living, breathing guide that connects you to the earliest generations of Muslims, their struggles, hopes, and unwavering faith. What stands out most is the sense of depth and reverence Ibn Kathir brings to every verse—his explanations are rooted in authentic sources, yet he never loses sight of the Qur’an’s spiritual and ethical dimensions. The stories of the prophets, the lessons drawn from the lives of past nations, and the detailed explanations of even the shortest surahs make the Qur’an feel both timeless and urgently relevant.\n\nWhat I find especially impactful is how Ibn Kathir’s tafsir bridges the gap between historical context and practical application. He often pauses to remind the reader of the mercy, justice, and wisdom embedded in the Qur’an’s guidance, and he doesn’t shy away from addressing difficult or complex passages. The tafsir is rich with narrations, linguistic insights, and reflections that invite you to slow down and ponder each verse—sometimes for hours. It’s a book that rewards patience and sincerity, and the more you return to it, the more you discover.\n\nOn a practical level, Tafsir Ibn Kathir has changed the way I approach the Qur’an. Instead of reading quickly or seeking only surface meanings, I’ve learned to ask deeper questions and to appreciate the interconnectedness of the Qur’an’s message. The reminders about patience, gratitude, humility, and reliance on Allah are woven throughout, and I often find myself reflecting on these lessons in daily life. Above all, the tafsir inspires a sense of awe and gratitude for the Qur’an as a source of light and guidance. If you want to truly understand the Qur’an—not just its words, but its heart—Tafsir Ibn Kathir is an invaluable companion.",

    description: "Clear Thinking by Shane Parrish is a practical guide to making better decisions and navigating the mental traps that cloud judgment. Drawing from years of research and his experience running Farnam Street, Parrish reveals how hidden forces like emotion, ego, and social pressure can hijack our thinking—and offers actionable strategies to regain clarity. With engaging stories and science-backed tools, the book empowers readers to recognize their blind spots, resist manipulation, and approach choices with calm, rational confidence. Whether you're facing a high-stakes business decision or a personal crossroads, Clear Thinking provides a blueprint for cutting through noise and seeing the world—and yourself—more clearly.",

    personalComments: "Reading Clear Thinking felt like having a wise, practical mentor gently nudge me to examine my own patterns of thought. Shane Parrish doesn’t just point out the ways we all get stuck—he offers a compassionate, systematic approach to getting unstuck. What I loved most is how approachable the book is: it’s filled with relatable stories, simple frameworks, and questions that linger long after you put it down. I found myself reflecting on moments when I let emotions or ego drive my decisions, and how easily I fall into the traps Parrish describes. The book doesn’t shame you for being human; instead, it gives you tools to pause, notice, and choose differently. \n\nOne of my biggest takeaways was the idea that clarity isn’t about suppressing emotion or pretending to be a robot. It’s about learning to recognize the forces at play—fear, pride, social pressure—and making space for thoughtful, deliberate action. Parrish’s advice feels refreshingly grounded: he acknowledges that we’ll never be perfect thinkers, but we can get better at noticing when we’re slipping into autopilot. The practical exercises—like the pause, the checklist, and the ‘red flag’ moments—are things I’ve started using in my daily life. \n\nWhat surprised me was how much the book applies beyond big, dramatic decisions. I found myself using the principles in everyday conversations, in how I respond to feedback, and even in how I plan my week. It’s made me more aware of my own stories and assumptions, and more willing to ask, ‘What am I missing?’ or ‘Is this really true?’ \n\nClear Thinking is the kind of book I’ll return to again and again, especially when I feel overwhelmed or stuck. It’s not about being right all the time—it’s about being honest with yourself, slowing down, and making choices you can stand behind. If you’re looking for a guide to better thinking—one that’s warm, practical, and deeply human—I can’t recommend this book enough.",

    publishedYear: 2019,
    isbn: "9780062917353",
    description: "Words of My Father is a deeply moving memoir by Yousef Bashir, chronicling his coming-of-age in Gaza amidst the turbulence and violence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The book intimately follows Yousef’s childhood in the border town of Deir al-Balah, where his family’s home becomes occupied by Israeli soldiers and his daily life is marked by checkpoints, curfews, and the constant threat of violence. Yet, at the heart of this narrative is the extraordinary influence of Yousef’s father, a steadfast advocate of nonviolence and forgiveness, who insists on meeting hatred with dignity and hope. Through harrowing events—including being shot and severely wounded as a teenager—Yousef learns to navigate loss, anger, and fear, ultimately embracing his father’s vision for peace. The memoir explores themes of trauma, resilience, and the transformative power of forgiveness, offering a rare window into the human costs of conflict and the possibility of reconciliation. Bashir’s story is both a testament to the pain of war and a luminous example of the strength it takes to choose empathy over vengeance, leaving readers with a profound sense of hope and a renewed belief in the capacity for healing.",

    personalComments: "Reading Words of My Father was a humbling and deeply emotional experience. Yousef Bashir’s story is not just a chronicle of suffering, but a testament to the extraordinary strength it takes to forgive in the face of injustice. What moved me most was the unwavering example set by his father—a man who, despite losing his home and enduring relentless hardship, refused to let hatred take root. The book challenged me to consider how easy it is to become consumed by anger when wronged, and how radical and courageous it is to choose compassion instead. There were moments when I felt Bashir’s pain and frustration so acutely that I wondered if I would have the same resilience or capacity for empathy in his place. Yet, by the end, I was left with a sense of hope that even in the darkest circumstances, the seeds of peace can be sown through small, daily acts of kindness and understanding. Bashir’s journey is a reminder that forgiveness is not about forgetting or excusing harm, but about breaking the cycle and reclaiming one’s own humanity. His story is both deeply personal and universally relevant, offering lessons about the cost of conflict, the power of family, and the quiet heroism of those who choose love over bitterness. It’s a book I’ll carry with me for a long time, and one I wish everyone could read—especially those who feel trapped by the weight of old wounds.",

Each law is illustrated through fascinating stories of strategy and deception, revealing how power can be wielded with subtlety or ruthlessness, depending on one’s goals.",

It’s sharp, uncomfortable, and brutally honest about human nature. While some laws feel manipulative, they’re also incredibly revealing — not just about others, but about ourselves. I learned that power isn’t necessarily about dominance; it’s about awareness, restraint, and knowing when to act. This isn’t a book to imitate blindly, but to study carefully. It teaches you to read people, recognize motives, and navigate social dynamics with intelligence instead of naivety.",

It challenges the traditional pursuit of stability and encourages flexibility, experimentation, and long-term thinking as the keys to real resilience.",

Instead of fearing disorder, it made me appreciate how chaos can actually make us stronger — if we’re prepared to learn from it. The ideas reminded me that avoiding risk often creates more fragility in the long run. I found myself thinking about how this applies to my own life — in teaching, learning, even planning. The book’s philosophy is both humbling and empowering: don’t try to control everything; build yourself in a way that benefits from shocks instead. It’s one of those reads that quietly changes how you approach problems and uncertainty.",

    personalComments: "Bygone Days felt deeply personal. It’s more than a love story — it’s a portrait of a society in transition. I was moved by Otabek’s conflict between honor and happiness, and by how Kumush embodies quiet strength in a patriarchal world. Qodiriy’s writing feels rich and layered, capturing both the beauty and pain of his time. It’s a timeless reminder of how love and principle often collide.",

Fugui’s journey from wealth to poverty, from pride to acceptance, made me rethink what survival really means. It’s a book that stays with you — one that teaches you to appreciate the ordinary moments we take for granted.",
