The amount of household waste has seen a notable rise across many nations, with food packaging constituting the largest portion of it. While this worrying trend can be attributed to consumerism and irresponsible use of single-use packaging, the solution may lie in educating the public and shifting to cleaner options. 

The rise of consumerist society is one of the primary reasons for the increased household waste. As the stream of products and different services continue to grow, many individuals are compelled to purchase a range of products that they may not even need due to aggressive marketing strategies, affordable pricing, and online shopping opportunities. Almost all of the products from such services come with significant packaging, most of which are non-recyclable. Such reckless purchasing habits directly translate into more waste at homes, such as clothes, food waste, and packaging, leading to a throwaway culture. 

Excessive use of non-biodegradable packaging is another major issue. Since plastic packaging is relatively cheap, accessible, and versatile, many organizations and companies rely heavily on it for many purposes. Plastic, being primarily tailored for single use, is also hassle-free given its benefits regarding hygiene of products, while other alternatives may carry bacteria and harmful contaminants. A single trip to a grocery store, for example, often comes with significant packaging. Individual fruits and vegetables are wrapped in plastic, all of which are also packed in another layer of plastic to facilitate handling for shoppers, thus resulting in a mountain of packaging at home. 

Remedying the problem requires immediate action, with educating being at the heart of it. The government, by raising awareness through programs and different projects, can inform individuals about the growing issue of packaging. Once aware of the negative effects of their habits, the public is likely to take preventative actions, including bringing their own bags for groceries or making mindful decisions. Japan is a prime example. There, children are taught the importance of protecting the environment from an early age and avoid unnecessary purchases, which encourages them to live zero-waste lifestyles. 

Equally important is strict regulations for plastic use. Instead of relying on non-recyclable packaging, which ends up in landfills and contaminates the environment, the state should incentivize the use of alternative and greener options, such as paper, glass, or recyclable plastic. However, single-use plastic remains significant for some purposes to avoid counter-effects; for daily choices and use, though, cleaner options should be prioritized to recycle domestic waste. Take Switzerland, for instance. The country has invested in the use of green sources and implemented policies for plastic packaging use, resulting in a cleaner environment and overall lower waste levels. 

To conclude, the problem of increasing domestic waste such as food packaging stems largely from consumerism and the excessive dependence on plastic packaging, I believe that it can be mitigated with the help of educational campaigns and switching to alternatives to non-recyclable plastic packaging. Although these solutions may not eliminate the use of plastic, as it will remain important in some regards, they can yield telling outcomes in terms of reducing waste.

Some people believe that everyone should allocate a fixed percentage of their incomes to charitable causes. While it may sound fair on the surface, I totally disagree with this view, as it fails to account for people's financial circumstances, undermines voluntary giving, and overlooks non-monetary contributions. 

Imposing obligatory donations overburdens individuals with too many financial commitments. While donating a small amount of money may seem negligible, even a minor deduction might lead to significant pressure, especially for those living paycheck to paycheck—such as freelancers with irregular earnings or those sustaining larger families. Even individuals residing in rural areas or cities with high living costs may earn the same salary but experience vastly different living expenditures. This form of imposition, therefore, would not feel like altruism but more like an additional tax, further pushing people into economic strain. 

An argument could be made that the policy can be adjusted by charging poorer households less or exempting them totally, while affluent citizens should bear larger share of the donation. However, this introduces another complex set of bureaucratic challenges, such as evaluating families' economic status and creating new frameworks—all of which require significant time and resources. Charity donations, by themselves, should be voluntary not mandatory. When it comes from heart, people foster empathy and compassion, but if they are obliged to allocate a portion of their incomes, they are likely to chafe at being told what to do with their hard-earned money, leading to resentment and dissatisfaction. 

Equally important is the fact that there are other forms of altruism apart from monetary donations. In many nations, the majority of people who may be financially constrained are willing to dedicate their time, energy, and expertise to those in need. Teachers, for example, often volunteer and give lessons on weekends to underprivileged children, while nurses may help patients in underserved regions outside their working hours, making a world of difference. This suggests that a genuine desire to help others should not be limited to cash, but it should be available in any forms and without strict guidelines. 

To conclude, although the suggestion that everyone should donate a fixed amount of money to charity may seem just, I do not buy this view due to a number of factors, such as real financial limitations people face, the potential for waste of time and resources, and neglecting the true nature of monetary donations. Instead of equating humanitarian aid with money, we should promote other types of donations which are equally significant and are not made out of guilt.

There is a view that governments should prioritize domestic issues over engaging in global problems, while others believe that the opposite is true in today's world. While both perspectives hold merit, I contend that there should be a balance between both, as neglecting either side would result in negative outcomes. 

Governments should actually serve their citizens at first. It would be unethical if they try to address global issues at the cost of domestic matters, such as famine, rising crime rates or poverty—problems that have a direct impact on people's lives. Take South Korea, for instance. For the past two decades, it focused heavily on more urgent needs of its public by improving living standards, including investing in education, enhancing healthcare, and upgrading infrastructures. These efforts have led to a growing and thriving society, enabling the country to considerably reduce crime rates, poverty, and illiteracy. 

However, others emphasize the highly interconnected nature of today's era, where different global issues do not seem to respect borders. With the rise of globalization, one challenge a country experiences might have a nationwide influence—economically, environmentally, and socially. The COVID-19 pandemic serves a great example. The disease originated in one country, but spread like wildfire across the globe, having devastating effects on many countries. This period of lockdown proved that no country is safe unless all nations are safeguarded, which requires a collaborated approach and collective agreements. 

Given these arguments, governments should try to both address local issues and engage in global conversations. Nowadays, cross-cultural collaborations are more important than ever before, meaning it would be unwise to focus solely on domestic cases. Germany, for example, leads by example. It is actively involved in international initiatives, but it also places importance on improving internal conditions. While an argument could be made that developing countries may be financially constrained to do the same, I feel that these nations should be selective when to contribute and invest in what truly matters. Alternatively, richer countries can support financially in times of need, as global issues have become problems of each nation. 

To conclude, I agree that authorities should be concerned more about the domestic problems, but overlooking global challenges is not a prudent course of action either, especially in today's day and age, when many problems transcend geographical borders. Thus, striking a balance between both commitments is the best approach, and to ensure every nation benefits from this action, developed countries should aid poorer ones.

Across many countries, vertical living has seen a significant rise for the past several years. While this increasing shift does entail certain drawbacks, especially in terms of space and acoustic challenges, I believe that the benefits, such as space efficiency and convenience, are far more significant. 

Living in a high-rise apartment block may come at the cost of personal space. In these apartments, people often find themselves confined to concrete cages and feel overwhelmed due to shared corridors, paper-thin walls, and the lack of sufficient greenery. For a person craving nature and freedom of space, these limitations will feel draining, leading to feelings of dissatisfaction, anxiety and even some health repercussions associated with the lack of connection with nature. 

Noise pollution is another major demerit. Since large apartment blocks house a significantly large number of people, noise tends to be quite high in those areas because of constant chatters, children’s voice, construction noise, and neighbors celebrating a party. Over time, individuals might become prone to auditory fatigue and mental exhaustion—which is particularly disruptive after a tiring and stressful day at work. My family, for example, finds it difficult to recharge at night in the presence of noise from all over the neighborhood, which often leads to lower productivity and energy levels. 

Nevertheless, I contend that vertical living has significantly improved urban lifestyles. One compelling merit is space efficiency. In densely populated cities, such apartment blocks can accommodate more people in a smaller footprint. Take Tokyo or Singapore as an example. These urban areas boast large apartments that not only provide a pleasant and compact look, but they also regulate urban sprawl, showing their importance in many nations with similar problems. 

Equally appealing are the convenience and safety these blocks offer. Most of the time, daily necessities, including shops, markets, schools, and even workplaces are within walking distance or are located not far from living accommodations—the convenience that considerably eases the commute times. Specialized zones for children and community gardens have also become common in large apartment blocks, providing a safe environment for children and community to interact and socialize. 

To conclude, although there are some disadvantages to living in large blocks, like shortage of space, the potential for health issues, and noise, I believe that given overpopulation in certain places, such accommodation options can be the most suitable choice. Not only do they serve more residents and provide safety, but also promote social cohesion through shared gardens in some communities.

When discussing the topic of arts, many people have different opinions on who can create art—some argue only a selected few with talents can become an artist, while others of the opinion that everyone can make a piece of artwork. While both perspectives hold merit, I believe that true artistry demands both hard work and talent. 

For some individuals, art is not just about expression, it is perfection. Some people have raw talents and abilities, such as composing, singing, or drawing—skills that others may never fully master even with years of exposure or training. Take Beethoven as an example. Despite his hearing difficulties, he demonstrated an extraordinary ability in music from an early age, which led him to create masterpieces of all time, showing how natural talents can be powerful. 

Others, however, contend that art is a universal form of expression—the language that everyone speaks. The idea that anyone can create an artwork by no means undermines the field’s value, as everyone possesses emotions, creativity, feelings, and life experiences, the core ingredients of a great work. Everything from a child’s doodles, quiet hums, and a mother’s culinary skills can be a certain form of art, reflecting inner feelings and a deep personal flair. 

In my view, arts have a low barrier to entry but high ceiling, meaning everyone can make a piece but only those with strong natural abilities or consistent practice can become true artists. A talent without hard work rarely leads to success stories or masterpieces that will be celebrated by many. Ed Sheeran exemplifies this idea. Although he might have had a natural talent for singing, it is through regular practice and vocal lessons that he was able to fine tune his voice within 10 years, becoming one of the most ‘naturally-gifted’ singers for some who may not know his consistent training in refining his voice. 

To conclude, arts can be indeed created by anyone as it reflects one’s internal emotions, but true artistry requires a certain talent in the field. However, the talent alone cannot be a sole contributor, as those who practice and improve their skills over time can attain success.

The word education is almost synonymous with children's school years and the period of studying during youth. However, there is a view that adults who might not have had an opportunity to study before should also be provided with specialized state-funded training courses. While some think that this view is not valid, I argue that re-educating adults is significantly important for two main reasons. 

Some people may believe that young generations' education should be the main area of focus. Since investing in adults' education might require substantial sums, some fear that it may divert funds away from the educational programs for youth. Children or young adults are, however, the driving force of a country, and they can have a more long-lasting as well as direct impact in countries' later sustainability compared to adults, who might have fewer years of productivity and may not bring such long-term positive effects. 

Nevertheless, I argue that this view neglects a more complex issue that stems from the worrying trend of increased illiteracy among adults—reduced academic engagement among children. As the saying goes: 'Everything starts with family', a deep love for knowledge acquisition is primarily nurtured by parents. Educated caregivers are better equipped to support their children's academic excellence through constant motivation, assistance with homework, academic resources, or by just reminding of the importance of education. By contrast, disadvantaged adults' children might mirror their lifestyles or habits, which can create a continuous cycle of illiteracy. 

Given these realities, overlooking adults' education is not favorable. By initiating programs aimed at improving and enhancing education for older individuals, governments can reduce unemployment, promote active citizenship, or nurture a more productive and skilled workforce. Take Germany as a striking example. The country places equal importance on both children's and adults' training programs, and the state has pioneered 'Re-skilling' campaigns, which have significantly minimized unemployment, contributed to a more engaged public and increased literacy rates. 

To conclude, investing in education of the adults from underprivileged backgrounds should not be seen as a luxury—it is a necessity. This is because such an initiative would not only benefit individuals but also society as a whole.

Ever since the potential for life on Mars was discovered, there has been an increasing tendency among people to contend that we should invest more resources in further researching such planets, as it might not be possible to live on Earth in the future. Although this view holds some merit, I disagree with it for two main reasons. 

Some believe that Mars, among other planets, is one of the most viable places for people to live in the future and is considered a back-up plan. As the world faces climate change and other difficulties, such as global warming, rising sea levels, and the extinction of species, some scientists fear that these issues are irreversible, thus turning to other solutions. SpaceX, for example, is actively developing technologies to make Mars a possible habitat in case of a catastrophic event. 

However, I think that this urge to explore space stems from human curiosity rather than necessity. The majority of oceans and marine life have not been studied yet, but scientists are quick to gravitate towards outer space in pursuit of seeing what lies beyond our planet. What they do not consider is that most solutions to the existing problems may lie in understanding our own planet first. Some studies in marine life and terrestrial exploration, for instance, have led to the discovery of essential chemicals and substances. 

In addition to human curiosity, there are also significant costs to bear if we are to commit to making Mars livable. Constructing new roads, towns, other necessary facilities and houses will require not only substantial funds but also decades to completely transform an uninhabited place. These efforts, though, are not even guaranteed to succeed and fully provide a new, untouched planet to live in. Instead of embarking on such a risky endeavor, it is wiser to channel those resources into improving life on Earth, such as developing cleaner technologies, shifting to greener alternatives, or initiating sustainable living projects. 

To conclude, space exploration is not actually a fruitless endeavor, but we should consider that it might be easier to address problems on our planet by researching oceans and deep levels. Beyond this, the cost of such exploration may be quite high, and redirecting that investment toward mitigating problems on Earth can be far more effective.

There is a view that tax education should be incorporated into school curriculum to prepare secondary school students for financial realities of adult life. While some are in favor of this suggestion, others disagree, believing that it would be a waste of time. While both perspectives hold merit, I lean toward the former view since tax education is of paramount importance. 

Some people are of the opinion that introducing tax education to young learners' school curriculum is widely beneficial. This subject can teach students the fundamentals, such as why people pay taxes, where taxes go, and the importance of paying them regularly, which equips students with the necessary skills to navigate adulthood with ease. Better literate graduates would not feel overwhelmed when they first encounter tax policies—after noticing that a chunk of their income has gone. A student who can file taxes, handle their paychecks, and who adheres to tax policies is not just a responsible citizen but a win for society. 

Others, on the other hand, think that the time dedicated for school subjects is already stretched thin, and students will be overburdened with additional lessons. They say that other seemingly more important disciplines, like math, science, and languages, play a more crucial role in students' future lives, while tax education may dilute that focus from core subjects. In addition to this, the constantly changing nature of tax policies often makes people question the relevance of tax education, as why students should spend their time on something that would ultimately change and become irrelevant? 

However, I argue that the goal is not to cultivate future accountants, the aim is to lay the foundation for financial literacy. Instead of focusing on carving out a new, full-blown course, it is better to embed tax lessons into the existing subjects, such as math, civic studies, and economics. A math teacher can also explain problems related to tax deduction while teaching percentages, or in civic lessons, a mentor can explain how tax-payer money is used by the government and why it is essential to pay taxes. Germany offers a compelling example. The schools here include tax education that is incorporated into related disciplines, which not only fosters civic engagement but also prepares students for adulthood. 

To conclude, the opinions remain divided on whether tax education should be a part of school curriculum or not—some encourage the view, while others feel that it would divert time and focus from more fundamental subjects. I maintain that lessons on tax do not require carving a new discipline, as it can be just taught with other similar subjects, and these efforts will undoubtedly pay dividends.

Some people believe that the values learned from family and parents are more important in attaining success in life compared to the knowledge and skills taught at schools and other institutions. While I agree that family plays a crucial role in societal and moral success, schools also have a profound impact on individuals' professional achievements, which makes me argue that success requires a combination of both family values and academic expertise. 

Family, undoubtedly, is the first institution of core virtues for everyone. Parents or grandparents in a family often instill fundamental, positive behavior and skills, such as perseverance, kindness, honesty, and respect for the elderly, in children. These qualities nurtured from a young age are of paramount importance in many facets of adulthood, including maintaining healthy relationships, building a social network, and staying persistent in one's goals. Many successful entrepreneurs often credit their upbringing as one of the most crucial indicators of their success, highlighting family's vital role. 

While such interpersonal skills lay the foundation for social and moral success, professional attainment often comes with academic knowledge. It is schools that provide an avenue for this type of success, which means deeming the knowledge and skills learned in schools useless is an oversimplification. An accountant with only personal virtues cannot climb the career ladder if they lack technical skills, which are often acquired in schools. These institutions also facilitate collaboration between students, work in teams, and communication with their students from different backgrounds—core skills that are highly sought after in today's job market. 

Given these realities, it is wise to acknowledge that there should be a healthy balance between both personal values and academic skills. Since the term 'success' can be defined in various ways, a truly successful individual is a person with a wide range of skills, not limited to virtues taught from parents. Take great leaders, for instance. They have attained success not only because of their interpersonal values but also thanks to their expertise in their fields, which would not be possible if they lacked either personal qualities or skills taught at school. 

To conclude, although values learned from family and parents have a significant influence in children's future lives, I maintain that the skills and knowledge acquired in schools should not be overlooked altogether. This is because success comes in different forms, such as emotional, personal, and professional achievements, prompting calls for striking balance between both sides.

Some believe that the primary goal of commercials is to maximize profits by convincing people to purchase products that they do not necessarily need. While advertising can be regarded as a perfect medium for financial gain, I contend that not all ads are designed to make people buy unnecessary things, and instead they aim to introduce a product to the public. 

These days, we are constantly bombarded with commercials at every step of the way, most of which create artificial desires. Aggressive marketing has become more prevalent than ever, employing emotional and psychological triggers to ignite curiosity in offers. Many ads seem to equate products with self-worth, empowerment, and status, convincing consumers that they will be happier, cooler, and even fully ‘complete’ if they purchase certain goods. Take some ads of sneakers, for instance: even if a person has a pair of sneakers, the ad may persuade them that they need another one to boost their productivity and improve their performance. 

However, reducing the main objective of advertising to mere financial gain is an oversimplification. Some commercials genuinely inform the public and try to reach a niche audience by explaining the purpose of their services or goods. Without such informative ads, customers would spend hours searching for products that meet their needs best, usually failing to find the right ones. Commercials of pills, for example, often clearly show what effects they may cause, who should take them, and when to avoid using them–helping consumers make better-informed decisions. 

Equally important is the role of commercials in the expansion of businesses. When companies first establish and do not have a customer base, the first platform they turn to is advertising, which enables them to introduce their offers to locals and build initial trust, potentially expanding their business. For instance, an ad for a new café can nudge locals to visit the place and enjoy different cuisines, which might not be possible if it were not for tailored ads. 

To conclude, although ads may seem to encourage impulsive buying and reckless spending habits when exaggerated, these are not always the case. I believe that not all of them are focused on only the financial side, as they also serve as a tool for informing the public and helping businesses reach a wider audience.

With road accidents ranking among the leading causes of death, especially among young people, some argue that raising the minimum driving age can be the most effective way to tackle the problem. While the perspective holds merit, I feel that there should be a combination of different measures concerning licensing education, stricter policies, and investment in infrastructure. 

Advocates of raising the legal driving age contend that age brings maturity and therefore, fewer accidents. The increasing number of road fatalities are believed to occur because of the characteristics of young teenagers, including risk-taking behavior, poor judgment, and inexperience, but older individuals are often cautious, less impulsive, and emotionally mature, which help them handle situations relatively easily. Countries with higher driving age like Sweden or Norway (18) consistently report lower rates of youth-related fatalities compared to ones where teenagers can drive at the age of 16. 

However, age alone is not the sole factor causing constant road accidents. In fact, carelessness, distraction, and even overconfidence are usually witnessed across all age groups, meaning delaying access to driving may not erase widespread traffic violations. Germany, for example, offers a compelling solution to such a problem. German learners undergo extensive training, informative lessons, and a tough licensing exam before being allowed to drive a vehicle – a method that has been the key in minimizing the road accidents. 

Strict law enforcement and infrastructure development can further strengthen the process of mitigating the issue. Speeding, drunk driving, and tailgating are common in many regions, which often lead to adverse outcomes. If drivers are fined and faced harsh, legal consequences, they are more likely to toe the line. However, there are also situations when poor lighting, pothole-driven roads, and other issues regarding the infrastructure can contribute to increased road fatalities, not because of drivers’ fault. These problems require urgent investment in the development of the area to ensure a safer environment for everyone. 

To conclude, although age can be a reason for road accidents, it is far from the only contributor. Road fatalities, in fact, often stem from a wide range of factors, such as drivers’ carelessness, irresponsible behavior, and poor road infrastructure – which are best alleviated through education, stringent rules as well as improved infrastructure.

In modern societies, the degree to which individuals rely on one another has become a subject of debate. While some argue that people today are more dependent on others than in the past, others claim that advances in technology and social change have fostered greater independence. I believe that although people may appear more autonomous in daily decisions, their lives are ultimately more interdependent than ever.

On the one hand, it is reasonable to suggest that people have become more independent. The digital revolution has allowed individuals to complete tasks that previously required assistance. For instance, online banking enables people to manage their finances without visiting a bank clerk, while remote work allows employees to operate from home rather than relying on physical offices. Moreover, modern education systems encourage independent thinking, urging students to pursue their own research and make informed choices. From this perspective, individuals have greater control over their professional and personal lives compared with earlier generations.

On the other hand, growing complexity in social and economic systems has made individuals highly dependent on one another. Daily conveniences such as electricity, healthcare, and transport rely on vast networks of professionals and institutions. For example, while a person may shop independently through a mobile application, that process still depends on software developers, delivery staff, and logistical infrastructure. In addition, the emotional dimension of human life remains unchanged: people continue to depend on friends and family for companionship and support, especially in times of crisis. Therefore, even apparent independence is underpinned by invisible forms of reliance.

In my view, modern life has created an illusion of independence while reinforcing underlying interdependence. People may no longer need neighbors to borrow tools or ask for directions, yet they are more reliant on complex systems and expertise than ever before. Rather than being purely independent or dependent, individuals today live in a state of mutual reliance, where autonomy in small matters is balanced by deep connections to society at large.

In conclusion, while individuals today enjoy more freedom in daily decision-making, their dependence on social, economic, and technological systems has only intensified. Acknowledging this interdependence is essential for building resilient communities in an increasingly interconnected world.

Space exploration has gained traction among people, where they are favoring their authorities to invest into this. However, others consider having this money to be aligned on aspects of Earth, such as solving various problems within. While sponsoring space companies could be considered a plausible decision, I believe that we have to prioritize the issues faced here on Earth.

The main reason for search of extraterrestrial life is scientific breakthroughs. It is through exploration of space, people, particularly the scientists, have found solutions to many engineering challenges. A chemical element known as alloy and composites that are now used in everythnig from modern aircraft to sports equipment for instance. There are a wide range of applications that have improved the boundaries of computing in addition to that, like paving the way for the powerful microchips in our smartphones and other devices that were basically derived through space exploration. While funding from government to this area may not sound tangible, there are a wide range of unexpected applications that improve life here on Earth, from medical imaging and water purification system to better weather forecasting and global communication networks. However, despite all these advancements, there should be a resolution to issues we experience on Earth.

Space missions are incredibly expensive, and the money could be redirected to solve immediate problems, like poverty, hunger, and disease to name a few. Before venturing to cosmos, the authorities should colloborate and question the ethical justification of searching for life on other plants when millions of people lack access to clean water, education, and basic healthcare. From this perspective, it is to a certain extent wasteful. In other words, extravagant and luxury that distracts from our fundamental responsibilites to one another and to Earth itself, since these benefits are often a slow and inefficient way to address problems that could be solved more directly and immediately with the same funds. In essence, we must fix our own house before building another one far away. Ultimately, rather than spending billions of dollars on a single space mission – which is an opportunity cost, governmental figures should consider combating global issues like poverty, hunger and climate change.

In conclusion, although there could be various solutions and breakthroughs that are only possible through scientific exploration to space, I believe that there should be a balance in between. However, solving problems on Earth should come atop, as it will allow us to continue evolving as humans, while the investments to space should only benefit the global society to the better.

People's conversations increasingly revolve around their income and how they spend it. While this development can be attributed to social expectations, fueled by the recent popularity of social media, it has detrimental effects on people’s mental health, making people less happy and contributing to social isolation. 

Social expectations play a significant role in shaping people’s behavior and aspirations, including their desire to talk about and display wealth. In many societies, there is a cultural emphasis on material success and the accumulation of wealth as a symbol of status, power, and achievement. This creates a pressure for people to meet those expectations and gain acceptance and recognition. 

This pressure is complicated by social media. Social media platforms often portray extravagant lifestyles and encourage people to flaunt their material possessions as a means of social validation. Instagram, for example, is known for its visual nature, where people showcase their luxurious lifestyles. Many users, especially influencers and celebrities, post photos and videos of their expensive cars, clothing, exotic vacations and high-end possessions to garner attention from their followers. These can inspire others to do the same. 

This constant need to brag about money has several implications on a person’s mental well-being. Firstly, when people see others showing off their wealth on social media or in real life, this can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Overtime, this comparison can create a sense of dissatisfaction with a person’s life and possessions, contributing to feeling of worthlessness and unhappiness. 

Besides this, constantly talking about money and flaunting wealth can cause social isolation. This is because such behavior can sometimes lead to a superficial approach to relationships. People may find it difficult to form genuine connections based on shared interests and values, as their relationship may be influenced primarily by the desire for social validation and financial gain. This can result in feeling of loneliness. 

In conclusion, the need to gain acceptance and recognition in the eyes of others coupled with the rise of social media are the primary reasons why people like to talk about money in their day-to-day conversations.  In my opinion, this turn of events are mostly undesirable as it can lead to unnecessary comparison with others and social isolation, negatively impacting people’s mental well-being.

There is a view that economic prosperity and environmental cleanliness can coexist, while others believe that one comes at the expense of the other. Whereas I understand the concerns about the environmental effects of economic success resulted from rapid industrialization, I still think that affluent countries are better positioned to make strides in terms of keeping the environment clean as they have resources to invest in sustainable practices and technologies and they can also provide assistance to other nations. 

The pursuit of economic growth can sometimes have negative consequences for the environment. This is mainly because rich countries generally prioritize industrialization. This often involves unchecked resource extraction and overconsumption of these resources. This process can lead to environmental degradation and ecological imbalance. China is a good case in point, where reliance on coal as a primary energy source has caused severe air pollution in many urban areas, resulting in health issues and environmental damage that impacted both human and ecosystem well-being. 

In my opinion, however, economically prosperous countries are better able to make advances in keeping the environment clean. Firstly, with greater financial resources, they can allocate funds to research and development of clean technologies, renewable energy sources, and environmentally friendly infrastructure. For example, these countries can invest in wind and solar power, as well as sustainable transportation and energy-efficient buildings. These innovations can have a positive impact on the environment by reducing pollution and mitigating climate change. 

On a broader level, high countries can assist the developing nations by offering financial aid to support environmental projects. This financial assistance can be directed towards initiatives such as renewable energy development, biodiversity conservation, and waste management. These efforts have the potential to significantly improve the environment and make valuable contributions to global environmental sustainability. 

In conclusion, the negative effects of economic growth mainly come from prioritizing industrialization. However, being economically successful allows countries to invest in research and development of methods that can improve the environment and to help low-income countries in this regard as well.

Government should fund the expenses of people who use public transport. In my opinion, it should not necessarily be free for everyone, instead free transportation should be aligned for those who cannot afford it.

A few groups of people could get free transport. People who suffer especially from physical and mental disability should apply for free transportation by the government. Such people have almost no chance to work to fund their commuting expenses, as their illness prevents them from earning money for work. These groups of people can often include senior citizens too. Despite the pension they get from the government, it still limits them from covering their basic needs, let along public transport. In addition, elementary school children deserve the same opportunity, however with some implications instilled to be regulated. Children from underprivileged background who lack finance can apply for it, only if certain laws are applied, to ensure it is not misused.

On the other hand, drivers who make sure passengers reach their destination safely and on time should get their salaries. These people have their own responsibilities as well, such as familial support. In the modern world, nearly all products, ranging from food to healthcare, have become expensive. This uptake in price means that they have to double their working hour shift. Nevertheless, a large number of people are still capable of paying for transportation, as it does not require from them much. Japan for example, provides financial support to nearly every senior citizen by paying for their health services, and public transport, while ensuring other people to pay for their transportation needs.

In my opinion, there should be some form of balance between free and paid transportation. Government should regulate between these people and allow some of them to apply for free public transport.

In conclusion, although some people cannot cope with the price that the public transportation demands, these cohorts should be sponsored. However, others, like employees or workers from many backgrounds should still pay for such purposes, as they are taxes and salaries that need to be paid.

Celebrities are often the most followed individuals. Therefore, they are advised to advertise healthy products instead of promoting harmful substances such as smoking. I firmly agree with this notion, because celebrities are role models to many young generation, but they should also have freedom and privacy.

Celebrities have a huge number of following. In platforms like Instagram and Facebook, these popular figures post contents based on their interest, career or anything alike. These contents often promote various products, ranging from health to clothing. That means, when celebrities advertise a particular product, they have to pay careful attention on what is being promoted. In other words, some products might be misleading. Not everything advertised digitally is useful, some of them often contain harmful additives which call allergies or other health related issues. Sugar drinks are the most advertised products followed by energy drinks in the world. A top YouTuber, MrBeast is the most followed person across many platforms. His product known as Lunchly contains high amount of calories and sugar which he claims to be healthy. However, this exact product raised health related concerns among children who are consuming it, like high blood pressure, and loss of appetite.

On the other hand, young people should be more responsible to their actions, instead of always blaming celebrities. Since young individuals lack understanding of a product, it is highly advisable for them to get more information or consult their parents about it. On top of that, parents should be more responsible for their childrens’ decisions while purchasing an item from popular celebrities. Because some well-known figures do their best to grow in social media platforms. And for this growth to happen, decent amount of capital is required, which usually can be acquired  by sponsorships and advertising of various products. Therefore, celebrities cannot always ensure safety to the youth, and thus, it is parents obligation to take care of what their children consume.

In conclusion, I believe that there are some aspects that can be controlled by celebrities in terms of advertisement, where they can choose a product to promote or refuse harmful ones. However, they should also get privacy and freedom to get to do whatever they want.

University education provides more opportunities to individuals than to overall society, ranging from career growth, and high-paying jobs, therefore the cost of this tertiary education should be covered by themselves. I completely agree with this notion, because it can teach to be more responsible in life and have a better financial awareness.

Students should learn to deal with tuition fees on their own. University offers not just a degree but also provides specialized knowledge and practical skills that directly improves the chances of employability. Upon graduation, they may secure well-paying positions and stable careers, which is benefited directly from their academic investment. Moreover, these types of education is not easily pursued, since it requires some sort of discipline, such as completing projects and assignments on time. Such responsibilities are demanding in current job markets. Therefore, if such perks are offered by the university, it is only fair they contribute financially on their own. In addition, learning to pay on their own, they are getting some sort of responsibility. In other words, they may learn to develop essential skills, such as budgeting, prioritizing expenses, and valuing education above entertainment. These traits may appear to be essential in today’s competitive job market.

On the other hand, there are a number of individuals who lack financial stability. Students from underprivileged backgrounds find it hard to afford the high cost of university. And, if they face almost similar financial pressure, there are likely to suffer from various mental health issues, such as stress, and academic performance. In fact, people in India, mainly students, have to work part time after their academic schedule to support their family. This is already a challenge for them in life, and taking another money related pressure will put greater unbearable burden into their future. Nevertheless, I believe that such individuals deserve support from the society or government by offering grants, and scholarships to ensure they have a better future. However, this form of support should not come without certain conditions to make sure it is not misused and that they give back to society after graduation and employment.

In conclusion, students should generally pay for their own education to become more responsible and independent in life. However, certain students deserve to get funded by the society and government but with certain conditions.

Professional athletes are now some of the most followed individuals in the world, which is why people believe those athletes should position themselves as role models for a younger generation. I agree with this notion since professional athletes represent the concept of sportsmanship and have a huge following.

Nearly any sport is based on the idea that opponents should respect one another, meaning sportspeople are often examples of how people should conduct themselves. This philosophy is not entirely new as sports events such as the Olympic games have always been associated with peace and fair competition. Thus, it is reasonable that we, as society, expect athletes to be role models for children and teenagers by showing them great athletic ability combined with moral compass. Sportspeople who fail to act as a role model may disrespect the sport they represent and its principles.

The world of sports has been commercialized to a point that we are highly likely to be influenced by a sport celebrity these days. In fact, two of the most popular people in the world are Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, both with hundreds of millions of followers on platforms such as Instagram. This is second reason why athletes should be role models as long as they want to have a positive impact both on and off the field. By choosing a path of a great role model, athletes can inspire and guide entire generations. Muhammad Ali, for example, is often celebrated for his attitude and behavior outside of a ring, representing values such as being truthful, dedicated and brave.

Failure to act as an exemplary athlete may lead to negative consequences such as distorting sports fans’ moral values. This is especially true in boxing and MMA, the sports where trash talking and disrespect have become quite evident, making some younger individuals imitate such behavior. Conor McGregor, for instance, has become notorious for his ability to trash talk his opponents and have an evil presence, and he, is arguably, the most popular MMA fighter in the world with millions of followers.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that sports people should prioritize being a role model along with becoming successful in their respective sports. This ensures that they showcase great sportsmanship and have a positive impact on young people.

Throughout history, animal species such as dinosaurs and dodos have naturally become extinct. Some people argue that since extinction is a natural process, human intervention to prevent it is unnecessary. However, I believe that human activity has caused far more harm than natural processes, and it is human interference that has placed many animals at risk of extinction today.

Historically, natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes have contributed to animal extinction by directly threatening wildlife populations. For example, earthquakes, and hurricanes elevate the extinction risk for mammals, birds and reptiles. These disasters can cause immediate deaths through various means including being crushed, drowned, or buried by debris like ash, lava or falling rocks. Therefore, natural disasters pose genuine threats to animal survival and can lead to extinction. However, the damage caused by human activities far exceeds that caused by natural processes.

Human exploitation of animals takes many forms worldwide. Reptiles such as crocodiles are hunted extensively for their valuable skin. Luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, use crocodile leather to make handbags, or jackets. Such practices threaten these species with extinction, even though many are already classified as endangered. Additionally, climate change has accelerated the melting of glaciers. This environmental change has severely affected polar bear populations. Consequently, polar bears struggle to find food as their hunting grounds disappear, which forces them to travel long distances in search of prey. Overhunting, on the other hand, is also popular among many fishermen’s, and those who hunt after furs of wolfs and foxes for monetary values. Ultimately, without a doubt, I can say that human have caused extensive damage to animals worldwide.

In conclusion, animals being harmed by natural disasters is inevitable. However, I strongly believe that, it is humans who are responsible for mass extinction of animals, and such animals include, polar bears, pandas and countless others.

Home-based education has been widely popular these days, especially to those who travel frequently. And, in some countries, this phenomenon is gaining attention among families who are preferring to educate their children at home rather than attending conventional schools. While there may be some benefits to this decision, I believe that children, in their formative years, should have more interaction with contemporaries. This results in better well-being and understanding of the real world, which far outweighs the advantages.

One major benefit of homeschooling is flexibility. Certainly, there are some children who cannot cope with school curriculum, and puts them under pressure, and leave little time for socializing and entertainment. Considering these challenges, some parents turn to online learning platforms, or even teach them themselves. Learning at home allows children to study at their own pace and choose their own schedule. However, such freedom makes them lazier and sedentary, which eventually becomes challenging to study in the foreground. Not to mention that they often than never need more social interaction.

Traditional schools, by contrast, follow a structured system tailored to students’ age and academic level. Take for example standardized tests, which frequently requires extensive preparation and discipline. This feature is made to classify a student according to their level, and slowly progress through many stages. In addition to this, interaction with their peers can be crucial, since communicating with them can remove anxiety, and make life-long friends. More importantly, these experiences prepare them to face real-world situations with greater awareness and better decision-making.

In conclusion, although there might some benefits in learning at home like keeping a child safe from community danger, or providing flexible learning. I, however would argue that school is a better option not only in terms of education, but also in terms of mental well-being and healthier future.

Housing is considered essential feature of people’s everyday lives. Thereby, suggesting that governing bodies should take control of supplying free housing to those who are in need. However, this sort of aid, should not come without strict regulations and monitoring, and should be provided to those who are less privileged, and eligible citizens.

Modern world has been experiencing a growing concern in housing. Developed nations around the world with their impressive per capita rate witness such situations rarely, while developing nations still have to cope with this issue, and seek further solutions to mitigate it. Brazil, for example, has over 1 million residents left with no proper accommodations, and large portion of these people are young adults and teenagers. As a result, these people engage in local gangs for chance to find a place to live. By joining, they contribute to various types of violence like drug trafficking, murder and many other felonies. This condition leads to a more growing concern in the community, other than housing. It is also worth and interesting to note, however, that Brazil is the same country who bravely invested 10 billion dollars to host FIFA World Cup in 2014, and the Summer Olympics in 2016. Some of this money could be invested on housing, and education instead.

While housing is crucial to many, it should not go without monitoring. Government should allocate the budget rationally by carefully investing the citizens employment status and their salary, since even those people with money may try to apply to such aid. Therefore, certificate of eligibility should be provided to prevent money being wasted when it can be invested to other essential needs.

In conclusion, indeed housing is important part of anyone’s live. Officials should create a well-calculated housing plans and programs to assist citizens in need, and successfully avert homelessness and its effects to the society.

Watching and performing sports has been popular in many countries. In fact, it has attracted a wide audience, particularly among men, creating a gap between them and their female counterparts. I believe that it is widely popular among men because it involves physical effort, which is often appreciated by male viewers. Similarly, many people prefer to watch male commentators and presenters over female ones.

These days, many people—particularly men—not only engage in sports but also frequently watch them. This provides a great opportunity for many channels that prioritize prestige and profitable revenue. A particular example is football, which has gained widespread appeal among men due to the excitement it brings and the revenue it generates for broadcasting channels. Moreover, combat sports like boxing and UFC require significant physical strength, not to mention the brutal nature and aggressive attitude demanded of participants. In fact, UFC has also provided opportunities for women, which has attracted public attention in many countries. Ultimately, it can be concluded that a larger male audience in sports provides broadcasting channels with both prestige and profit, in addition to opportunities to advertise various products.

Achieving a balance between both genders in sports coverage requires effort. Many young women have turned to social media, as it not only helps them become public figures but also allows them to gain substantial profits from investors. When it comes to sports, female interest has been surprisingly low, according to a study conducted over 30 years. However, if TV channels broadcast women's sports for the same number of hours as men's, it may attract significant attention from young females, benefiting their overall well-being. Take, for example, gymnastics, which is popular among girls and women. This sport has provided various benefits to females in terms of physical appearance and body shape. These factors are especially important to many women, making it a widely followed sport. In addition, equal broadcasting would promote gender equality. However, some argue that famous brands may be less willing to market their products during women's sports, as it takes extensive time to gain media attention in mainstream society.

In conclusion, while men continue to dominate many areas—especially in sports—women should be given equal opportunities to increase the importance of sports among the female generation, despite concerns about reduced revenue due to a smaller audience.
