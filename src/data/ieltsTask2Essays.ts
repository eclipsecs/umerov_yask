Space exploration has gained traction among people, where they are favoring their authorities to invest into this. However, others consider having this money to be aligned on aspects of Earth, such as solving various problems within. While sponsoring space companies could be considered a plausible decision, I believe that we have to prioritize the issues faced here on Earth.

The main reason for search of extraterrestrial life is scientific breakthroughs. It is through exploration of space, people, particularly the scientists, have found solutions to many engineering challenges. A chemical element known as alloy and composites that are now used in everythnig from modern aircraft to sports equipment for instance. There are a wide range of applications that have improved the boundaries of computing in addition to that, like paving the way for the powerful microchips in our smartphones and other devices that were basically derived through space exploration. While funding from government to this area may not sound tangible, there are a wide range of unexpected applications that improve life here on Earth, from medical imaging and water purification system to better weather forecasting and global communication networks. However, despite all these advancements, there should be a resolution to issues we experience on Earth.

Space missions are incredibly expensive, and the money could be redirected to solve immediate problems, like poverty, hunger, and disease to name a few. Before venturing to cosmos, the authorities should colloborate and question the ethical justification of searching for life on other plants when millions of people lack access to clean water, education, and basic healthcare. From this perspective, it is to a certain extent wasteful. In other words, extravagant and luxury that distracts from our fundamental responsibilites to one another and to Earth itself, since these benefits are often a slow and inefficient way to address problems that could be solved more directly and immediately with the same funds. In essence, we must fix our own house before building another one far away. Ultimately, rather than spending billions of dollars on a single space mission – which is an opportunity cost, governmental figures should consider combating global issues like poverty, hunger and climate change.

In conclusion, although there could be various solutions and breakthroughs that are only possible through scientific exploration to space, I believe that there should be a balance in between. However, solving problems on Earth should come atop, as it will allow us to continue evolving as humans, while the investments to space should only benefit the global society to the better.

People's conversations increasingly revolve around their income and how they spend it. While this development can be attributed to social expectations, fueled by the recent popularity of social media, it has detrimental effects on people’s mental health, making people less happy and contributing to social isolation. 

Social expectations play a significant role in shaping people’s behavior and aspirations, including their desire to talk about and display wealth. In many societies, there is a cultural emphasis on material success and the accumulation of wealth as a symbol of status, power, and achievement. This creates a pressure for people to meet those expectations and gain acceptance and recognition. 

This pressure is complicated by social media. Social media platforms often portray extravagant lifestyles and encourage people to flaunt their material possessions as a means of social validation. Instagram, for example, is known for its visual nature, where people showcase their luxurious lifestyles. Many users, especially influencers and celebrities, post photos and videos of their expensive cars, clothing, exotic vacations and high-end possessions to garner attention from their followers. These can inspire others to do the same. 

This constant need to brag about money has several implications on a person’s mental well-being. Firstly, when people see others showing off their wealth on social media or in real life, this can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Overtime, this comparison can create a sense of dissatisfaction with a person’s life and possessions, contributing to feeling of worthlessness and unhappiness. 

Besides this, constantly talking about money and flaunting wealth can cause social isolation. This is because such behavior can sometimes lead to a superficial approach to relationships. People may find it difficult to form genuine connections based on shared interests and values, as their relationship may be influenced primarily by the desire for social validation and financial gain. This can result in feeling of loneliness. 

In conclusion, the need to gain acceptance and recognition in the eyes of others coupled with the rise of social media are the primary reasons why people like to talk about money in their day-to-day conversations.  In my opinion, this turn of events are mostly undesirable as it can lead to unnecessary comparison with others and social isolation, negatively impacting people’s mental well-being.

There is a view that economic prosperity and environmental cleanliness can coexist, while others believe that one comes at the expense of the other. Whereas I understand the concerns about the environmental effects of economic success resulted from rapid industrialization, I still think that affluent countries are better positioned to make strides in terms of keeping the environment clean as they have resources to invest in sustainable practices and technologies and they can also provide assistance to other nations. 

The pursuit of economic growth can sometimes have negative consequences for the environment. This is mainly because rich countries generally prioritize industrialization. This often involves unchecked resource extraction and overconsumption of these resources. This process can lead to environmental degradation and ecological imbalance. China is a good case in point, where reliance on coal as a primary energy source has caused severe air pollution in many urban areas, resulting in health issues and environmental damage that impacted both human and ecosystem well-being. 

In my opinion, however, economically prosperous countries are better able to make advances in keeping the environment clean. Firstly, with greater financial resources, they can allocate funds to research and development of clean technologies, renewable energy sources, and environmentally friendly infrastructure. For example, these countries can invest in wind and solar power, as well as sustainable transportation and energy-efficient buildings. These innovations can have a positive impact on the environment by reducing pollution and mitigating climate change. 

On a broader level, high countries can assist the developing nations by offering financial aid to support environmental projects. This financial assistance can be directed towards initiatives such as renewable energy development, biodiversity conservation, and waste management. These efforts have the potential to significantly improve the environment and make valuable contributions to global environmental sustainability. 

In conclusion, the negative effects of economic growth mainly come from prioritizing industrialization. However, being economically successful allows countries to invest in research and development of methods that can improve the environment and to help low-income countries in this regard as well.

Government should fund the expenses of people who use public transport. In my opinion, it should not necessarily be free for everyone, instead free transportation should be aligned for those who cannot afford it.

A few groups of people could get free transport. People who suffer especially from physical and mental disability should apply for free transportation by the government. Such people have almost no chance to work to fund their commuting expenses, as their illness prevents them from earning money for work. These groups of people can often include senior citizens too. Despite the pension they get from the government, it still limits them from covering their basic needs, let along public transport. In addition, elementary school children deserve the same opportunity, however with some implications instilled to be regulated. Children from underprivileged background who lack finance can apply for it, only if certain laws are applied, to ensure it is not misused.

On the other hand, drivers who make sure passengers reach their destination safely and on time should get their salaries. These people have their own responsibilities as well, such as familial support. In the modern world, nearly all products, ranging from food to healthcare, have become expensive. This uptake in price means that they have to double their working hour shift. Nevertheless, a large number of people are still capable of paying for transportation, as it does not require from them much. Japan for example, provides financial support to nearly every senior citizen by paying for their health services, and public transport, while ensuring other people to pay for their transportation needs.

In my opinion, there should be some form of balance between free and paid transportation. Government should regulate between these people and allow some of them to apply for free public transport.

In conclusion, although some people cannot cope with the price that the public transportation demands, these cohorts should be sponsored. However, others, like employees or workers from many backgrounds should still pay for such purposes, as they are taxes and salaries that need to be paid.

Celebrities are often the most followed individuals. Therefore, they are advised to advertise healthy products instead of promoting harmful substances such as smoking. I firmly agree with this notion, because celebrities are role models to many young generation, but they should also have freedom and privacy.

Celebrities have a huge number of following. In platforms like Instagram and Facebook, these popular figures post contents based on their interest, career or anything alike. These contents often promote various products, ranging from health to clothing. That means, when celebrities advertise a particular product, they have to pay careful attention on what is being promoted. In other words, some products might be misleading. Not everything advertised digitally is useful, some of them often contain harmful additives which call allergies or other health related issues. Sugar drinks are the most advertised products followed by energy drinks in the world. A top YouTuber, MrBeast is the most followed person across many platforms. His product known as Lunchly contains high amount of calories and sugar which he claims to be healthy. However, this exact product raised health related concerns among children who are consuming it, like high blood pressure, and loss of appetite.

On the other hand, young people should be more responsible to their actions, instead of always blaming celebrities. Since young individuals lack understanding of a product, it is highly advisable for them to get more information or consult their parents about it. On top of that, parents should be more responsible for their childrens’ decisions while purchasing an item from popular celebrities. Because some well-known figures do their best to grow in social media platforms. And for this growth to happen, decent amount of capital is required, which usually can be acquired  by sponsorships and advertising of various products. Therefore, celebrities cannot always ensure safety to the youth, and thus, it is parents obligation to take care of what their children consume.

In conclusion, I believe that there are some aspects that can be controlled by celebrities in terms of advertisement, where they can choose a product to promote or refuse harmful ones. However, they should also get privacy and freedom to get to do whatever they want.

University education provides more opportunities to individuals than to overall society, ranging from career growth, and high-paying jobs, therefore the cost of this tertiary education should be covered by themselves. I completely agree with this notion, because it can teach to be more responsible in life and have a better financial awareness.

Students should learn to deal with tuition fees on their own. University offers not just a degree but also provides specialized knowledge and practical skills that directly improves the chances of employability. Upon graduation, they may secure well-paying positions and stable careers, which is benefited directly from their academic investment. Moreover, these types of education is not easily pursued, since it requires some sort of discipline, such as completing projects and assignments on time. Such responsibilities are demanding in current job markets. Therefore, if such perks are offered by the university, it is only fair they contribute financially on their own. In addition, learning to pay on their own, they are getting some sort of responsibility. In other words, they may learn to develop essential skills, such as budgeting, prioritizing expenses, and valuing education above entertainment. These traits may appear to be essential in today’s competitive job market.

On the other hand, there are a number of individuals who lack financial stability. Students from underprivileged backgrounds find it hard to afford the high cost of university. And, if they face almost similar financial pressure, there are likely to suffer from various mental health issues, such as stress, and academic performance. In fact, people in India, mainly students, have to work part time after their academic schedule to support their family. This is already a challenge for them in life, and taking another money related pressure will put greater unbearable burden into their future. Nevertheless, I believe that such individuals deserve support from the society or government by offering grants, and scholarships to ensure they have a better future. However, this form of support should not come without certain conditions to make sure it is not misused and that they give back to society after graduation and employment.

In conclusion, students should generally pay for their own education to become more responsible and independent in life. However, certain students deserve to get funded by the society and government but with certain conditions.

Professional athletes are now some of the most followed individuals in the world, which is why people believe those athletes should position themselves as role models for a younger generation. I agree with this notion since professional athletes represent the concept of sportsmanship and have a huge following.

Nearly any sport is based on the idea that opponents should respect one another, meaning sportspeople are often examples of how people should conduct themselves. This philosophy is not entirely new as sports events such as the Olympic games have always been associated with peace and fair competition. Thus, it is reasonable that we, as society, expect athletes to be role models for children and teenagers by showing them great athletic ability combined with moral compass. Sportspeople who fail to act as a role model may disrespect the sport they represent and its principles.

The world of sports has been commercialized to a point that we are highly likely to be influenced by a sport celebrity these days. In fact, two of the most popular people in the world are Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, both with hundreds of millions of followers on platforms such as Instagram. This is second reason why athletes should be role models as long as they want to have a positive impact both on and off the field. By choosing a path of a great role model, athletes can inspire and guide entire generations. Muhammad Ali, for example, is often celebrated for his attitude and behavior outside of a ring, representing values such as being truthful, dedicated and brave.

Failure to act as an exemplary athlete may lead to negative consequences such as distorting sports fans’ moral values. This is especially true in boxing and MMA, the sports where trash talking and disrespect have become quite evident, making some younger individuals imitate such behavior. Conor McGregor, for instance, has become notorious for his ability to trash talk his opponents and have an evil presence, and he, is arguably, the most popular MMA fighter in the world with millions of followers.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that sports people should prioritize being a role model along with becoming successful in their respective sports. This ensures that they showcase great sportsmanship and have a positive impact on young people.

Throughout history, animal species such as dinosaurs and dodos have naturally become extinct. Some people argue that since extinction is a natural process, human intervention to prevent it is unnecessary. However, I believe that human activity has caused far more harm than natural processes, and it is human interference that has placed many animals at risk of extinction today.

Historically, natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes have contributed to animal extinction by directly threatening wildlife populations. For example, earthquakes, and hurricanes elevate the extinction risk for mammals, birds and reptiles. These disasters can cause immediate deaths through various means including being crushed, drowned, or buried by debris like ash, lava or falling rocks. Therefore, natural disasters pose genuine threats to animal survival and can lead to extinction. However, the damage caused by human activities far exceeds that caused by natural processes.

Human exploitation of animals takes many forms worldwide. Reptiles such as crocodiles are hunted extensively for their valuable skin. Luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, use crocodile leather to make handbags, or jackets. Such practices threaten these species with extinction, even though many are already classified as endangered. Additionally, climate change has accelerated the melting of glaciers. This environmental change has severely affected polar bear populations. Consequently, polar bears struggle to find food as their hunting grounds disappear, which forces them to travel long distances in search of prey. Overhunting, on the other hand, is also popular among many fishermen’s, and those who hunt after furs of wolfs and foxes for monetary values. Ultimately, without a doubt, I can say that human have caused extensive damage to animals worldwide.

In conclusion, animals being harmed by natural disasters is inevitable. However, I strongly believe that, it is humans who are responsible for mass extinction of animals, and such animals include, polar bears, pandas and countless others.

Home-based education has been widely popular these days, especially to those who travel frequently. And, in some countries, this phenomenon is gaining attention among families who are preferring to educate their children at home rather than attending conventional schools. While there may be some benefits to this decision, I believe that children, in their formative years, should have more interaction with contemporaries. This results in better well-being and understanding of the real world, which far outweighs the advantages.

One major benefit of homeschooling is flexibility. Certainly, there are some children who cannot cope with school curriculum, and puts them under pressure, and leave little time for socializing and entertainment. Considering these challenges, some parents turn to online learning platforms, or even teach them themselves. Learning at home allows children to study at their own pace and choose their own schedule. However, such freedom makes them lazier and sedentary, which eventually becomes challenging to study in the foreground. Not to mention that they often than never need more social interaction.

Traditional schools, by contrast, follow a structured system tailored to students’ age and academic level. Take for example standardized tests, which frequently requires extensive preparation and discipline. This feature is made to classify a student according to their level, and slowly progress through many stages. In addition to this, interaction with their peers can be crucial, since communicating with them can remove anxiety, and make life-long friends. More importantly, these experiences prepare them to face real-world situations with greater awareness and better decision-making.

In conclusion, although there might some benefits in learning at home like keeping a child safe from community danger, or providing flexible learning. I, however would argue that school is a better option not only in terms of education, but also in terms of mental well-being and healthier future.

Housing is considered essential feature of people’s everyday lives. Thereby, suggesting that governing bodies should take control of supplying free housing to those who are in need. However, this sort of aid, should not come without strict regulations and monitoring, and should be provided to those who are less privileged, and eligible citizens.

Modern world has been experiencing a growing concern in housing. Developed nations around the world with their impressive per capita rate witness such situations rarely, while developing nations still have to cope with this issue, and seek further solutions to mitigate it. Brazil, for example, has over 1 million residents left with no proper accommodations, and large portion of these people are young adults and teenagers. As a result, these people engage in local gangs for chance to find a place to live. By joining, they contribute to various types of violence like drug trafficking, murder and many other felonies. This condition leads to a more growing concern in the community, other than housing. It is also worth and interesting to note, however, that Brazil is the same country who bravely invested 10 billion dollars to host FIFA World Cup in 2014, and the Summer Olympics in 2016. Some of this money could be invested on housing, and education instead.

While housing is crucial to many, it should not go without monitoring. Government should allocate the budget rationally by carefully investing the citizens employment status and their salary, since even those people with money may try to apply to such aid. Therefore, certificate of eligibility should be provided to prevent money being wasted when it can be invested to other essential needs.

In conclusion, indeed housing is important part of anyone’s live. Officials should create a well-calculated housing plans and programs to assist citizens in need, and successfully avert homelessness and its effects to the society.

Watching and performing sports has been popular in many countries. In fact, it has attracted a wide audience, particularly among men, creating a gap between them and their female counterparts. I believe that it is widely popular among men because it involves physical effort, which is often appreciated by male viewers. Similarly, many people prefer to watch male commentators and presenters over female ones.

These days, many people—particularly men—not only engage in sports but also frequently watch them. This provides a great opportunity for many channels that prioritize prestige and profitable revenue. A particular example is football, which has gained widespread appeal among men due to the excitement it brings and the revenue it generates for broadcasting channels. Moreover, combat sports like boxing and UFC require significant physical strength, not to mention the brutal nature and aggressive attitude demanded of participants. In fact, UFC has also provided opportunities for women, which has attracted public attention in many countries. Ultimately, it can be concluded that a larger male audience in sports provides broadcasting channels with both prestige and profit, in addition to opportunities to advertise various products.

Achieving a balance between both genders in sports coverage requires effort. Many young women have turned to social media, as it not only helps them become public figures but also allows them to gain substantial profits from investors. When it comes to sports, female interest has been surprisingly low, according to a study conducted over 30 years. However, if TV channels broadcast women's sports for the same number of hours as men's, it may attract significant attention from young females, benefiting their overall well-being. Take, for example, gymnastics, which is popular among girls and women. This sport has provided various benefits to females in terms of physical appearance and body shape. These factors are especially important to many women, making it a widely followed sport. In addition, equal broadcasting would promote gender equality. However, some argue that famous brands may be less willing to market their products during women's sports, as it takes extensive time to gain media attention in mainstream society.

In conclusion, while men continue to dominate many areas—especially in sports—women should be given equal opportunities to increase the importance of sports among the female generation, despite concerns about reduced revenue due to a smaller audience.
