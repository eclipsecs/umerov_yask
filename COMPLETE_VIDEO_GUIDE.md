# Complete Guide: Adding Video Support to Articles

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented video support for your articles. Here's exactly what was done and how to use it:

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. **Updated Article Interface** (`src/data/articles.ts`)
- Added `video?: string` field to the Article interface
- Added video import section with clear comments
- Set up example demonstrating video + thumbnail combination

### 2. **Enhanced Article Detail Page** (`src/pages/ArticleDetailPage.tsx`)
- Videos take priority over images when both are present
- Added HTML5 video player with controls
- Image serves as video poster/thumbnail when both exist
- Fallback to image display when no video is present

### 3. **Created Video Assets Directory**
- `src/assets/article-videos/` folder for video files
- Comprehensive README with step-by-step instructions
- Generated sample thumbnail to demonstrate the feature

## 🎬 How to Use Video Support:

### Step 1: Add Your Video File
Place your video in `src/assets/article-videos/`
- **Recommended format**: `.mp4` (best browser support)
- **Other supported**: `.webm`, `.ogg`
- **File size**: Keep under 50MB for web performance

### Step 2: Import the Video
In `src/data/articles.ts`, add import at the top:
```javascript
import myVideo from '@/assets/article-videos/my-video.mp4';
```

### Step 3: Link to Your Article
Add the video property to your article:
```javascript
{
  id: '1',
  title: 'My Article with Video',
  // ... other properties
  video: myVideo,        // <-- Your video here
  image: myThumbnail,    // <-- Optional: Used as video poster
}
```

## 🎯 Video Display Logic:

1. **Video Only**: Video plays without poster image
2. **Video + Image**: Video plays with image as poster/thumbnail
3. **Image Only**: Regular image display (existing functionality)
4. **Neither**: No hero media (existing functionality)

## 📱 Features Included:

- ✅ HTML5 video player with native controls
- ✅ Responsive design (works on all devices)
- ✅ Video poster/thumbnail support
- ✅ Fallback image display when no video
- ✅ Maintains existing image functionality
- ✅ Videos only show in detail page (not in article listing)
- ✅ Proper error handling for unsupported browsers

## 🚀 Live Example:

Article #2 is set up as an example - it has a thumbnail ready and comments showing where to add the video import. Just uncomment the video line and add your actual video file!

## 📁 File Structure:
```
src/
├── assets/
│   ├── article-images/     # For article images
│   └── article-videos/     # For article videos ← NEW!
│       ├── README.md       # Detailed instructions
│       └── sample-video-thumbnail.png
├── data/
│   └── articles.ts         # Updated with video support
└── pages/
    └── ArticleDetailPage.tsx # Enhanced with video display
```

The implementation is complete and ready to use! Just add your video files and follow the import pattern shown in the documentation.
